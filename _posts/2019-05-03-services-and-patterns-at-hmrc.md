When I started working at HMRC, their new customs services were working independently of each other. This meant that there was a duplication of work and effort, and that meant that inconsistent patterns were being used across these services making the experience more difficult for their users.

As part of the service design team I was responsible for setting the patterns and designing any shared journeys across the services.

To do this I arranged pattern workshops and was part of design crits with the other designers and user researchers from across the service area to understand the designs that were being used and how they were understood by users.

Using the insight gained at these workshops, I designed a number of patterns which used elements of the original designs and could be implemented across the area.
