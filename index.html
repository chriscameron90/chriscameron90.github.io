			I&#8217;m an interaction designer, specialising in designing accessible and usable services that real people can use.

		<p class="app-body app-body--home">
			I currently work at the Government Digital Service (GDS) working on <a class="app-link app-!-font-size-20" href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">GOV.UK Forms</a>.

			<li>
				worked as part of a multidisciplinary team to create a form creation platform that is accessible and usable by form creators (civil servants) 
			</li>
			<li>
				used my knowledge and expertise to inform how the Forms platform generates forms that can be hosted on GOV.UK that citizens can use 
			</li>
      <li>
        talked about the Forms platform at multiple events, including <a class="app-link app-!-font-size-20" href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/summit-preview-breakout-tracks-and-mainstage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Code for America May 2023</a>
