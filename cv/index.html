			While working within a mutli-disciplinary agile team I have worked to deliver designs which meet the needs of our users and the requirements of the organisation. I have worked on multiple projects across the customs area of the organisation, and on a cross cutting project taking a service design approach to unifying the many services in this business area.

			A number of the services I have worked on have been assessed under the HMRC assessment and successfully progressed to the next phase. I am a trained HMRC assessor, which means I understand the GDS Service Standard principles well and can advise on how projects should meet them.
