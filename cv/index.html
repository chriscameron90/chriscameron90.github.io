		<p class="app-heading--xs app-heading--key app-!-margin-bottom-0">Key Responsibilities:</p>
    <p class="app-body">
      I have been working on <a class="app-link" href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank">GOV.UK Forms</a> to create a form building platform that helps civil servants create accessible online forms that can be used by citizens to interact with government, reducing the need for PDFs. As part of my time working on Forms, I have helped design the original iteration of the platform, building HTML prototypes using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, to test the platform concept. I then contributed to the design of the overall form creation journey and interactions for new priority features to help us adapt the platform to bring more forms onboard. Some of the features I have worked on to date include:  
    </p>
    <ul class="app-list app-list--bullet">
      <li>
        <strong>question routing</strong> - this allows form creators to control the journey a form filler will see depending on answers given so that form fillers only answer the questions that are relevant to them
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>payment links</strong> - this allows form fillers to pay a fee using a GOV.UK Pay link (another GOV.UK service) so that they can complete their whole task in a single journey
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>confirmation emails</strong>  - this gives form fillers the option to recieve a “receipt” of their submission as they often need proof or reassurance that the task was completed
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="app-body">
      While working at GDS I have become a mentor to a number of mentees who have been exploring interaction design as a career. As part of the One Million Mentors programme, I supported my mentee through the transition from a front-end developer role to become an interaction designer with a UK Government department.
